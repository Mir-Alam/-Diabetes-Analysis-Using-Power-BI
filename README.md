# Diabetes-Analysis-Using-Power-BI
This project presents an basic analysis of a diabetes dataset with a focus on two primary objectives: Comparison of Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes &amp; Diabetes Diagnostic Criteria
The analysis was performed using Power BI to uncover meaningful insights and support data-driven conclusions.

# Project Objectives
Compare Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes:
Explore demographic, clinical, and statistical differences between the two major types of diabetes.

Analyze Diagnostic Criteria:
Understand and visualize how diagnostic markers (e.g., blood glucose levels, HbA1c, BMI) vary and align with established medical guidelines.
# 🛠️ Tools Used
Power BI for data visualization and interactive dashboards

Microsoft Excel / CSV for dataset preprocessing (optional, if applicable)

Publicly available diabetes dataset

# 🔍 Key Insights
Visual comparison of Type 1 vs. Type 2 diabetes across age, gender, and other variables

Distribution of key diagnostic features like fasting glucose, BMI, and HbA1c

Clear illustrations of how diagnostic thresholds apply to different patient profiles
